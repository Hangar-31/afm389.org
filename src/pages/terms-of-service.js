      </H31Item1>
      <H31Item1>
        You are solely responsible for your own User Content and the
        consequences of posting or publishing it. You affirm, represent, and/or
        warrant that: you own, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents,
        and permissions to use and authorize CFMA to use, all patent, trademark,
        trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to all User

        of and display your User Content (and your user name) in any medium in
        connection with the activities and operations of CFMA, its affiliated
        entities and successors. You also hereby grant each user of the CFMA
        Website a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the

        that CFMA may retain, reproduce, distribute and otherwise use for any
        purpose copies of User Content that has been removed from the Website.
        The above licenses granted by you are perpetual and irrevocable.
      </H31Item1>

    <br />
    H. Ability to Accept Terms of Service
    <br />
    <br />

    you and CFMA relating to any matter dealt with in the Terms of Service. If
    any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of
    competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect
    the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which
    shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these
    Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term
    or any other term, and CFMA’s failure to assert any right or provision under
