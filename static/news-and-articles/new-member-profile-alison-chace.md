Alison says: "It's great to finally be a local musician here in the Orlando area. I have been a musician for 24 years. I first experienced violin through the elective circuit in middle school, discovered violin in orchestra class, and have been in love since! I have studied with Dr. Jacob Dakon, Dr. Nancy Bargerstock, and Dr. William Terwilliger. My greatest hopes and dreams are to continue inspiring future generations of musicians both through performing in teaching and to bring joy to the community through sharing music. My greatest joy comes from knowing young musicians have been inspired through what I've shared and knowing when someone has found comfort in joy in performances I have been a part of. Music is medicine for the soul and my life's goal is to continue spreading that medicine for those who need it."\

Alison is currently teaching orchestra at Jones High School. She came from New York where she was involved in three symphonies, a string quartet, and had a community of pit orchestra friends in the Hudson Valley. She hopes to connect to the musicians and musical groups in the area and start performing professionally again in the upcoming year.\
