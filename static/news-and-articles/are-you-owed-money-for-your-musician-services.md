Did you know that it is not that uncommon for musicians in Central Florida to be paid less than agreed upon wages, or worse, not be paid at all? This is one of the reasons filing a contract with us is so important. Over the years we have recovered literally thousands of dollars for our members who have been taken advantage of in this fashion, ranging from $85 for one individual to as much as $8,000 for another.

 

Fortunately for some, we have been able to recover funds even in situations where no written contract was signed, although we do not recommend that you offer your talents without specific terms and conditions agreed upon in writing.



Please give the office a call if you find yourself in this situation!
