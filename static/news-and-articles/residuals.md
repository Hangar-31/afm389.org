We have discussed the importance of having our recordings covered in newsletters. Well, as a testimonial, about two and a half years ago a local orchestra performed under a Union Recording Agreement. The recording continued to be used on the producer’s website in what is called “reuse” cycles, causing each musician to receive a payment of over $1,000 for the continued use! Also, because the product continues to be used, each musician can expect payments to continue!



We believe this is just one more reason you want to make sure any recordings you work on are covered by a Union agreement.
