Rehearsal space is one of the greatest needs and largest monthly expenses for bands and performing artists. In our research, we have found facilities requesting $25 per hour (at the low end) and hundreds of dollars per month at the high end.  As a member of our association, rehearsal space is free! Our facility is conveniently located on the east side of downtown Orlando, just off of the 408, and it is available 24/7. 

For all of the details (Rules, restrictions etc…), click on the “Rehearsal Hall” tab at the top of any page of this web-site.
