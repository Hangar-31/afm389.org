**FROM RICHARD BRADY**

This has been a challenging time for all Musicians but things are starting to get better for live music. 
I am a member both here and Atlanta and I have been doing recordings and a live tent series with Atlanta opera. Also 38 performances of nutcracker with the Atlanta ballet. Here in Florida there have been a few performances with some community groups and local ensembles that have kept music fun. Happy holidays to everyone.

**FROM ADAM GRIM**

This year has brought a lot of change in our lives, but it does not stop us from pursuing music as a life-long career! Teaching during COVID has been a totally different struggle, especially in Title 1 schools, but luckily not everything is doom and gloom. Within the school, we just had the first concert given in over two years! 

Outside of school, I have had three compositions reviewed by the Percussive Arts Society in Percussive Notes (and can be found at permus.com), and had an ensemble win Third Prize in the Medici International Music Competition for Chamber Music with my composition called "The COVID Awakening." This work won first prize in the 21st Century Talents International Music Competition for Composition as well. It was my first true chamber work written and recorded by myself during the pandemic, and carried itself highly through the North Star New Music Festival at Truman State University in Kirksville, Missouri before moving onto international acclaim. These were my first international awards not supported by a school or university, and my quartet colleagues deserve some appreciation as well. 

Moving to Orlando, I hoped I would see the potential for new opportunities. I hope you all find some of those opportunities and successes in 2022, and I hope we can make the next year better than any before. My website is [adamgrim.weebly.com](adamgrim.weebly.com).

**FROM BRANDON MILLER**

Brandon Kyle Miller is a CFMA member from Orlando. He plays electric and double bass, teaches at Eastern Florida State College, and composes for his band ANSWERS (or playfully titled, “The Name of the Band is Answers”).

Over the last two years, he worked with Chris Belt on guitar (Executive Director at Timucua Arts Foundation), Beatriz Ramirez on oboe (Opera Orlando), Caitlin Pequignot on violin (Airtable), and Thad Anderson (Associate Professor of Music at UCF) on vibrakit—a combination of vibraphone and drum kit with effects—on the ANSWERS album. It’s title, “A New Path to Touch the Earth,” represents the challenges of navigating quarantine, social media, personal life, and art during a pandemic. The album is a perfect blend of the group’s contemporary-classical-meets-open-improvisation, with nods to the 70’s great prog rock bands while still sounding completely fresh. The piece itself is a 30-minute journey in three movements. 


ANSWERS performed the piece in its entirety at the University of Central Florida as part of Thad Anderson’s faculty recital, as well as at Eastern Florida State College in Cocoa, Florida as a part of Brandon Miller’s faculty recital. The band gladly recorded the full album later that week at Phat Planet Studios in Orlando, Florida on September 10, 2021. ANSWERS is absolutely thrilled to have John McEntire (Soma Studios) of the band Tortoise mixing and mastering the album, with a slated release for early 2022. 


Apart from ANSWERS, Brandon performs locally in Orlando with Joey Fatone’s Fat Tones Band, at St. Luke’s United Methodist Church in Windermere, and much more. He performed six musicals in 2021 at Orlando Shakes, Osceola Arts, Theater West End in Sanford, the Abbey in Orlando, the Garden Theater, and accompanying West Orange High School. He recently played bass on and produced Adam Scharf’s new record, “This Wild Little Lifetime,” during the pandemic–now available on most streaming platforms. Brandon’s next big project in 2022 is music directing the 50th anniversary concert of the 70’s hit record “The Way” by Bobby Callender.
