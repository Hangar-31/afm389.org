Our members frequently ask for tips to prepare for an open call Disney audition. Here are our Top 3:

1) Know as much as you can about the musical role you’re interested in. For example, if your goal is to substitute with The Jammitors, we suggest watching YouTube videos of the band, or, better yet, watch the band live at the park and, if possible, chat with them after the show.

2) Everything you prepare should be relevant to the job you have in mind. In other words, if you are interested in convention work as a rock musician, prepare short snippets of a variety of rock tunes ranging from a rock ballad to a more upbeat party songs.

3) Remember, it’s Disney, so personality is very important. Be friendly, look the panel directly in the eye when you introduce yourself and while performing.

We are happy to offer more personalized guidance. Just call the office to set up an appointment.
