The National Law Review has published an article that should be considered a “must read” for any person or organization booking talent. There are some misconceptions of what constitutes an employee/ employer relationship and the consequences of mis-classification can be costly. This article does not directly address the fines and penalties, however, the information is helpful to those who are contracting musicians in determining their employer status. The article can be found [here](http://www.natlawreview.com/article/orchestra-left-without-chair-when-music-stops-another-independent-contractor).
