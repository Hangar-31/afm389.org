Doing any traveling as a musician?

If you have done much traveling with your instrument via the airlines, chances are you have faced a challenge or two on occasion -- anything from an airline refusing to allow your instrument to be included as a carry-on item (even if it fits in the common spaces provided), to issues with the handling of your prized possession. 

 

The AFM has lobbied congress and worked with the airlines to relieve some of our concerns. So, if you plan to travel with your instrument in the future, checkout the “AFM Travel Kit” [here](https://www.afm.org/what-we-are-doing/travel-resources/afm-travel-kit/). 

Once there, you will find links for instruction on the following topics: 

* Carrying on your instrument
* Carrying on your larger instrument
* Major airline policies
* Checking your instrument as baggage
* Problems at the Airport
* Filing complaints 

Safe travels!
