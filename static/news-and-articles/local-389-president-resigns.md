L﻿ongtime Local 389 President Mike Avila resigned as of July 15, 2023. He offered the following as a farewell message to Mike. 

To my dear friends, colleagues, and fellow musicians,
	It has been said (and memorialized in song by The Byrds): “To everything there is a season…a time for every purpose under heaven.” 
	With that as a backdrop, it is with mixed emotions of sadness, joy and gratitude that I write this message of a change in season.
	Sadness, because after 24 years serving our musicians, the time has come for this old man to retire. Joy, because of the many wonderful relationships forged. And gratitude for these years of kind friendship and trust you have given me!
	There truly are no words to even remotely express the depth of thankfulness I have for each of you, and the accompanying emotion attached to this decision as a result. 
	From the bottom of my heart, with every ounce of my being, thank you for these 24 years of a most wonderful season of life!
	My last day will be Saturday, July 15, after which Local 389 treasurer Sam Zambito will begin serving as interim President for the duration of this term of office (December 31, 2023). Also in the interim, Local 389 Vice President Debbie Dansby will serve as Secretary Treasurer.


In your service,

M﻿ike Avila



**We thank you for your service, Mike, and wish you the best!**
