O﻿n April 18, 1924, the Orlando chapter of the American Federation of Musicians - Local 389 - was chartered. Originally known as the Musicians' Protective Association, and later the Orlando Musician's Association, the current Central Florida Musicians' Association now boasts more than 600 members.

M﻿any of those members were on hand on April 13, 2024 at the Orange County Regional History Center as we kicked of a year of celebration. Music of the 1920's was provided by the Palm Beach Society Orchestra (formerly known as Disney's Grand Floridian Society Orchestra). 

A﻿ second celebration was held on the actual anniversary - April 18 - at the Union Hall. Music was provided by Carol Stein & Friends, and then several members took part in a jam session. The City of Orlando's Doug Richards was also on hand to issue a special proclamation - Central Florida Musicians' Association Centennial Celebration Day!

S﻿pecial thanks to the Music Performance Trust Fund and Carol Stein & Lee Wolfson for funding both parties!
