Okay, I’m with you. Attending an “informational gathering” doesn’t sound very exciting, but it may very well be the most important meeting you can attend as a union member, and here’s why:

Did you know that you can get group medical insurance, 25% off car rentals, dental insurance, credit counseling, discounts on theme park admissions, and roadside assistance that is about half the cost of that national-ranking motor club. In fact after our very first gathering, one member saved hundreds of dollars on a mortgage application using the UnionPlus mortgage program.

Our goal is that every member takes advantage of the opportunity to hear about these and other benefits. Members will receive an email notifying them of the dates of upcoming meetings.
