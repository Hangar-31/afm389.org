  One of the first things I did when I moved to Orlando in 2011 was to contact
  Local 389 and join the Union. Ever since then, the CFMA staff has been
  enormously helpful in advancing my music career in Central Florida: from
  notifying me about auditions and events, to networking with other musicians
  and making excellent rehearsal space available, the Union and my Local have
  been invaluable. I continue to be a proud member and would recommend it to any
  active musician in the Orlando area!
