text: Live music, and the ability to make a living from musical endeavors, is
  precious in a town that thrives on arts and entertainment. When musicians
  unite, we can stand together to foster and support fairness and integrity for
  working artists. AFM389 has always been a staunch advocate and supporter of
  these ideals.
