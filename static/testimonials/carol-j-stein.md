text: Being in the AFM is essential for a professional musician. The AFM helps protect you and helps provide quality and safe performances! It enables you to continue your love of performing while providing you with resources and knowledge of “The Biz!” The pension plan is an awesome benefit which most musicians are grateful for to help with future financial security. The camaraderie of fellow professionals is priceless.
